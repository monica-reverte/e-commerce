This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run fake-api` 

I made a fake-api with JSON document and to see this products you need to run the fake-api.
